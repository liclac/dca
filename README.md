dCa
===

The only [DCA](https://github.com/bwmarrin/dca/wiki/DCA1-specification) (Discord Audio) encoder you'll ever need (probably).

It's written in C, it should be pretty fast, it wraps ffmpeg, and it can be used as a library. You could probably write bindings to other languages too!

Building
--------

You need [CMake](https://cmake.org) v3.1 or later.

```
cmake .
make
./bin/dca
```
